## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

Hello! I'm Timothy, an aspiring Software Engineer. I have a strong passion for software development. Over the years, I've gained experience in a variety of technologies for fullstack development. I recently got the chance to contribute to AI and ML research at Algoverse. I am also excited to intern at SLAC this summer as well to conduct some research regarding AI.

I believe in continuous learning and am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills. When I'm not coding, I enjoy ~long walks on the beach~ playing video games and working out at the gym.

## üèÜ Internship Experience

Here are some highlights of my internship experience:

### Science Undergraduate Laboratory Intern | SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory | June 2025 - Present
#### Responsibilities & Achievements:
- Developing physics-informed neural networks to predict simulation results in accelerator physics and EM analysis
- Optimizing Python-based simulations on HPC systems for complex physical modeling
- Integrating ML frameworks with computational physics tools to accelerate workflows and improve accuracy
- Collaborating with domain experts to ensure AI models align with physical laws and experimental data

### Artificial Intelligence Research Intern | Algoverse | Jan 2025 - May 2025
#### Responsibilities & Achievements:
- Utilized a hybrid mBERT+BiLSTM model for figurative language detection, trained on low-resource Konkani
- Achieved an accuracy of 83% for idiom classification and 78% for metaphor classification
- Preserved 100% of original accuracy on idiom classification while pruning attention heads
- Achieved 88% accuracy retention on metaphor classification tasks through strategic model parameter reduction

### Engineering Success Research Intern | San Jose State University | Sept 2023 ‚Äì April 2024
#### Responsibilities & Achievements:
- Researched AR technology to simulate physics phenomena, visualizing wave mechanics and 3D vector fields
- Applied Dr. Peter Beyersdorf‚Äôs research to explore AR‚Äôs role in immersive and accessible physics education
- Proposed AR-driven virtual labs as a likely cost-effective alternative, with estimated savings of 30% over 3‚Äì5 years
- Tested AR Physics applications on the Meta Quest 3, assessing user interaction and simulation precision
